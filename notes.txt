1. // default route pattern, Home folder then Index.cshtml file
   app.MapControllerRoute(name: "default", pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

2. Controller name (without the controller part) has to match folder name of Views
   example: ItemsController has to have a View folder named Views/Items, inside the folder the 
            cshtml file can have any name.

3. app.MapControllerRoute(name: "default", pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
   http://localhost:5232/items/edit?id=5 [query param]
   http://localhost:5232/items/edit/5 [path param]

   [as per pattern, {id}, http://localhost:5232/items/edit/5 will only work if controller 
    method param is named id, if named anything other than id then query param has to be used
    query param works all the time, path param only works if method param is named id or whatever
    pattern is set in app.MapControllerRoute()]

4. foreach loop in razor:
   <ol>
        @foreach (string item in list)
        {
            <li>
                @item
            </li>
        }
    </ol>

5. ifelse:
   @if (loggedIn)
    {
        <h2>
            "You are logged in"
        </h2>
    }
    else if (!loggedIn)
    {
        <h2>
            "You are logged out"
        </h2>
    }

6. Razor Directives:
   @page, @model, @using [most common]
